{Remote Network debugging and monitoring for Distributed Caches}

*   Introduction

    The ehcache-1.x-remote-debugger.jar} can be used to debug replicated cache operations. When started with the same configuration as the
    cluster, it will join the cluster and then report cluster events for the cache of interest. By providing a window into the cluster
    it can help to identify the cause of cluster problems.

*   Packaging

    From version 1.5 it is packaged in its own distribution tarball along with a maven module.

    It is provided as an executable jar.

*   Limitations

    This version of the debugger has been tested only with the default RMI based replication.

*   Usage

    It is invoked as follows:

--------------------------------------------

java -classpath [add your application jars here]
 -jar ehcache-debugger-1.5.0.jar ehcache.xml sampleCache1
    path_to_ehcache.xml [cacheToMonitor]

--------------------------------------------

   Note: Add to the classpath any libraries your project uses in addition to these above, otherwise RMI will attempt to load them
   remotely which requires specific security policy settings that surprise most people.

   It takes one or two arguments:

   * the first argument, which is mandatory, is the Ehcache configuration file e.g. app/config/ehcache.xml. This file should be configured to allow
   Ehcache to joing the cluster. Using one of the existing ehcache.xml files from the other nodes normally is
   sufficient.

   * the second argument, which is optional, is the name of the cache e.g. distributedCache1

   If only the first argument is passed, it will print our a list of caches with replication configured
   from the configuration file, which are then available for monitoring.

   If the second argument is also provided, the debugger will monitor cache operations received for the given cache.

   This is done by registering a CacheEventListener which prints out each operation.


** Output

   When monitoring a cache it prints a list of caches with replication configured, prints notifications as they
   happen, and periodically prints the cache name, size and total events received. See sample output below which
   is produced when the RemoteDebuggerTest is run.

   Caches with replication configured which are available for monitoring are:

   Received removeAll notification.

** Providing more Detailed Logging

   If you see nothing happening, but cache operations should be going through, enable trace (LOG4J) or finest (JDK) level
   logging on <code>net.sf.ehcache.distribution</code> in the logging configuration being used by the debugger.
   A large volume of log messages will appear. The normal problem is that the CacheManager has not joined the cluster.
   Look for the list of cache peers.


** Yes, but I still have a cluster problem

   Check the FAQ where a lot of commonly reported errors and their solutions are provided. Beyond that, post to the forums or mailing
    list or contact Ehcache for support.
