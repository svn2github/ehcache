        11.3 comes as a WAR or as a complete server
    12. Java EE and Applied Caching
        12.1 Blocking Cache to avoid duplicate processing for concurrent operations

    Java Requirements
    =================

        Ehcache 1.7.2 and above supports Java 1.5 and 1.6 at runtime. Ehcache final releases are compiled with -target 1.5.

        The Ehcache 1.5 branch is being maintained for Java 1.4 users.

    Dependencies
    ============

        SLF4J API and one concrete logging implementation. The API jar and the JDK14 logging jar are included in the distribution.

    Maven POM snippet
    =================

         All Ehcache releases are placed in the central Maven repository.
         
         The Maven snippet for Ehcache core is:

         &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupid&gt;net.sf.ehcache&lt;/groupid&gt;
            &lt;artifactid&gt;ehcache-core&lt;/artifactid&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;${project.version}&lt;/version&gt;
         &lt;/dependency&gt;
         
         The Maven snippet for Ehcache and Terracotta is (pulling both core and Terracotta dependencies):

         &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupid&gt;net.sf.ehcache&lt;/groupid&gt;
            &lt;artifactid&gt;ehcache&lt;/artifactid&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;${project.version}&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;type&gt;pom&lt;/type&gt;
         &lt;/dependency&gt;    

    Installation
    ============
    Place the ehcache-core.jar, slf4j-api.jar and slf4j-jdk14.jar, or the concrete SLF4J logging implementation library of your choice into your classpath.

    For use with Terracotta, copy the ehcache-terracotta.jar to your classpath.

    Create an ehcache.xml configuration from the one supplied in the distribution and place it in the root of your classpath.

    The Terracotta server is in the terracotta directory. It includes start and stop scripts.

    For Maven based development, there is a tc-maven-plugin which works much like the Jetty plugin. See UsingWithMaven.txt,
    which shows how to add the server to your integration test phase and interactive command use.

    For Ant based development, the tc-maven-plugin can be called from Ant. See UsingWithAnt.txt,
    which shows how to add the server to your Ant build, and how to use the server interactively from Ant.


    Samples
    =======
    See the samples directory for ready-to-run samples which show to use the full features of Ehcache, including use with Terracotta.



    Documentation
    =============
    See  http://ehcache.org/documentation for full documentation.

    The JavaDoc is in the distribution and also online at <a href="http://ehcache.org/apidocs">http://ehcache.org/apidocs</a>

    Licenses
    ========
    This kit contains ehcache code which is governed by the Apache License, version 2.0. The license is in the licenses folder.
    It also contains the Terracotta server which is governed by the Terracotta Public License, version 1.0.

    Ehcache 1.7.1 and higher uses SLF4J for logging. The SLF4J license is included in the licenses folder.

    Known Issues
    ============

    1. There are a number of known issues and workarounds for Tomcat. See the Using Ehcache with Tomcat chapter
       in the online documentation.

    2. See the FAQ online for a current list.
