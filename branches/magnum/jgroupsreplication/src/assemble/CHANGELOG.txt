        Upgrade JGroups to 2.10

    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="add" fix="EHC-760>
        Support registration of JGroups with JMX.
    </action>
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="add" fix="EHC-383>
        Use Ehcaches rather than Caches, so that decorated caches can also be replicated.
    </action>
    <action dev="Eric Dalquist" type="update">

       Significant clean up and improvement of the code base from Eric Dalquist, a production user
       of ehcache jgroups replication.

       1.  Significant improvement to logging at all levels to provide easier debugging of configuration
         and runtime execution

       2.    Use JGroups Channel directly instead of NotificationBus which was documented as demonstration code.
             The NotificationBus also performed a significant amount of cluster state tracking which was not needed for Ehcache integration. This change also removed a layer of object serialization which should reduce the messages sizes slightly.

       3.   Allow configuration of JGroups from a separate file. This allows the XML configuration files that
            JGroups provides to be used directly instead of translating them into the connect string inline in the ehcache.xml file.

       4.   Moved the Ehcache CachePeer and JGroups Receiver implementations into their own classes instead of having the main CacheManagerPeerProvider implement all of the interfaces. This also fixes a potential class reference leak where the old JGroupManager passed a reference to this to another class in its constructor.

       5.   Moved bootstrap handling code into its own class.

       6.   Use a ThreadPoolExecutor to handle requesting cache bootstrap and responding to cache bootstrap. The pool defaults to zero threads and will dynamically grow and shrink as needed.

       7.   Expanded the messaging around bootstrapping to allow peers to signal if they were not able to respond to a bootstrap request.

       8.   Now that a bootstrap should always return a response the simple thread.sleep approach used previously to wait for the bootstrap to complete is no longer needed. a CountDownLatch is used so that the Receiver of the bootstrap complete message can signal the bootstrap request thread that it is done. A 30 second max wait timeout is still used as a fail-safe in case of a lost message. In general this results in a significantly faster bootstrap process.

       9.  Bootstrap requests are now tracked by the bootstrap manager. This allows for more graceful shutdown of the cache manager in the case of a still-pending bootstrap request as well as a cache manager's ability to decline responding to a bootstrap request that it is currently in the process of being bootstrapped from another peer.

       10.  Remove JGroupSerializable which essentially cloned the functionality of JGroupEventMessage. Since JGroupEventMessage is serializable it is passed directly.
